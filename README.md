# Discord Weather App

**March 15th, 2020**

A weather app for Discord. Given a city, it can give the current data for weather description, temperature, and wind speeds, all in Metric.
My first take at APIs.

## How to use

* Download the code and fill in the Bot token and API Key from [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* In the channel, use the prompt *!weather* and follow that with the city name
* For example, *!weather Toronto*
* The bot should do it's thing!
